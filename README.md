# Learning Structural Errors

## Source codes
1. Ensemble Kalman inversion
2. Numerical simulator of Lorenz 96 system

## Data files
1. Scripts to generate training data of long trajectories and closures
2. Data files for indirect training

## Examples
1. Direct training examples for Lorenz 96 system (c=10 and c=3)
2. Indirect training examples for Lorenz 96 system
	- Local error model (c=10 and c=3)
	- Nonlocal error model (c=3)
	- Stochastic error model (c=3)
